ShadowCanvas – DevOps & Development Documentation
Project Overview
ShadowCanvas is a full-stack collaborative whiteboard application enabling real-time multi-user canvas editing, authentication, canvas sharing, and multi-canvas session management. The project follows structured DevOps practices including CI validation and protected branch workflows.
Architecture Overview
Frontend
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Socket.io client
- Axios for REST APIs
- React Router for navigation
Backend
- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
- JWT authentication
- Passport.js OAuth
- Socket.io server for real-time sync
Git Workflow Strategy
The project follows a feature-branch development model.

Branch Structure:
- main → Stable branch
- feature/* → New features
- fix/* → Bug fixes

Development Flow:
1. Pull latest main
2. Create feature branch
3. Implement changes
4. Commit & push branch
5. Create Pull Request
6. CI pipeline runs automatically
7. Merge only if checks pass
Continuous Integration (CI)
CI Tool Used: GitHub Actions
CI configuration files are located in .github/workflows/ and include:
- frontend-ci.yml
- backend-ci.yml
Frontend Pipeline
Stages:
- Install dependencies (npm install)
- Lint (npm run lint)
- Build verification (npm run build)

Purpose:
- Enforce code quality
- Ensure production build succeeds
Backend Pipeline
Stages:
- Install dependencies (npm install)
- Syntax validation (node --check src/index.js)

Purpose:
- Catch syntax errors
- Ensure backend integrity
Quality Gate Enforcement
Pull Requests cannot be merged unless all CI checks pass. This enforces integration stability and prevents faulty code from entering the main branch.
Security Practices
- JWT authentication with expiration
- bcrypt password hashing
- OAuth 2.0 (Google & GitHub)
- Secrets stored in .env (excluded from version control)
- CI secrets managed using GitHub Actions Secrets
Feature Contributions
